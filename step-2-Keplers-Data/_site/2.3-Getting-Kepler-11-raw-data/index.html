<p>Now that you are used to play with the stack and know the available series, let’s manipulate some data!</p>

<h2 id="fetch">FETCH</h2>

<p>Now that we have identified the right star, let’s get some data using <a href="/reference/functions/function_FETCH/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">FETCH</code></a>! It is a function similar to find, with more arguments that gives the boundaries of a window to get raw datapoints. The UTC start date is <code class="highlighter-rouge">2009-05-02T00:56:10.000000Z</code> and the end date is <code class="highlighter-rouge">2013-05-11T12:02:06.000000Z</code>. Remember that the regular expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">~.*</code> allow you to request all the series available in the platform. Limit it to only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sap.flux</code> ones. In order to keep a restreint amount of data, update the labels sector to load only the data from Kepler-11, i.e. data with the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">KEPLERID=6541920</code>:</p>

<warp10-embeddable-quantum warpscript="
// Storing the token into a variable
@HELLOEXOWORLD/GETREADTOKEN 'token' STORE 

// Let's do a FETCH now
[
    // Here you must put the parameters used by FETCH:  
    // - Token for application authentication
    // - Classname selector
    // - Labels selector
    { 
        // Here you put the label selector for Kepler-11
    } 
    // - Start date
    // - End date
]
FETCH
">
</warp10-embeddable-quantum>

<p>You will see a list containing a single time series, <strong>click on it to view it</strong>. As an exercise, you can re-use the find and create a regular expresssion to load a small amount of the stars data. Loading the complete set of data <strong>will</strong> probably crash your navigator.</p>

<h1 id="to-be-continued">To be continued</h1>

<p>The full subset of data of Kepler-11 is now on top of a WarpScript stack. It includes around 65000 points. In the next steps, we will start to write a WarpScript data-flow to detect Kepler-11 exoplanet.</p>
